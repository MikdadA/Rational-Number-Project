We aim to handle fractions in C++; however, there is currently no built-in support for rational numbers. Despite having integers (int), 
we lack a dedicated rational number class. Our objective is to design a class, known as the Rat class or Rational number class, 
to introduce the functionality of working with fractions in C++.
